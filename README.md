Disclaimer: This was a project I thought about but do not recommend using it as GGG has stated to individuals that they do not want them to log in game chat.

# PoeGuildDiscordRelay
A python script which works with a discord bot to relay any guild chat messages that are created in your Client.txt file.

Problems: At this time I do not want to continue to work on this as I need to work on some web app projects, but what I was trying to do was have the bot run the functions to read the Client.txt and when a new line is printed with thee specific guild tag variable then to have the bot send that message to a predefined channel. I noticed it was printing duplicate lines and have tried a number of ways to get it to stop but I have not been successful.
